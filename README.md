# PHPLinksyoutubeAPIs
This PHP script checks the status of YouTube videos using the YouTube Data API. It loops through a list of video links, extracts the video IDs, and makes API requests (up to 5000 times) to retrieve information like upload status, privacy settings, and embeddability. It pauses between requests to avoid exceeding rate limits.
